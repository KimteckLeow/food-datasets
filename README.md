A list of food-related datasets provided as a [Simple Data Format Data Package](http://dataprotocols.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simple-data-format.html), compiled at a [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.ch) workshop in preparation for the [Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch). The metadata was collected by us through web searches, and is provided as "best effort", without any guarantee of correctness.

To contribute new datasets or make modifications to the underlying spreadsheet, please see instructions in our [Data Expedition](https://schoolofdata-ch.github.io/2018/01/01/Food-Data-Expedition.html)
